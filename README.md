# Agents Prompts

A collection of **system prompts** used across the **Developers Secrets** ecosystem, primarily designed and tested with **Claude Code** by Anthropic.

These prompts define the behaviors, roles, and reasoning structures of the AI agents that power Developers Secrets products.  
They serve as the foundation for consistent, high-quality agent behavior across internal tools, developer assistants, and automated workflows.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide a **centralized, versioned library** of prompt templates used to:

- Standardize the way AI agents reason and respond  
- Define reusable system roles for developers and assistants  
- Improve reproducibility across different environments (Claude Code, OpenAI, etc.)  
- Enable experimentation and refinement of prompt architectures
